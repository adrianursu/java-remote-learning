(Pig Latin) Write an application that encodes English language phrases into pig Latin. Pig Latin is a form of
coded language often used for amusement. Many variations exist in the methods used to form pig Latin
phrases. For simplicity, use the following algorithm:
To translate each English word into a pig Latin word, place the first letter of the English
word at the end of the word and add the letters "ay." Thus the word "jump" becomes "umpjay," the word "the"
becomes "hetay" and the word "computer" becomes "omputercay." Blanks between words remain as blanks.
Assume the following: The English phrase consists of words separated by blanks, there are no punctuation
marks and all words have two or more letters.
