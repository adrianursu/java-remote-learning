Write an application that uses random number generation to create sentences. Use four arrays of strings called
article, noun, verb and preposition. 

Create a sentence by selecting a word at random from each array in the
following order: article, noun, verb, preposition, article and noun. As each word is picked, concatenate it to the
previous words in the sentence. The words should be separated by spaces. When the final sentence is output,
it should start with a capital letter and end with a period. The program should generate 20 sentences and output
them in console.

The arrays should be filled as follows: the article array should contain the articles "the", "a", "one", "some" and "a
ny"; the noun array should contain the nouns "boy", "girl", "dog", "town" and "car"; the verb array should contain
the verbs "drove", "jumped", "ran", "walked" and "skipped"; the preposition array should contain the prepositions
"to", "from", "over", "under" and "on".

After the preceding program is written, modify the program to produce a short story consisting of several of
these sentences
